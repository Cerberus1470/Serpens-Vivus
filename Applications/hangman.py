"""
This program is a game of hangman! It will randomly select a word from 4 different categories, displays what category was chosen, and gives the player 5 incorrect guesses before the potato man is hung. Dark, I know right? The fate of a man lies in
your ability to guess a word. Good luck! Side note: I thought we were supposed to have a working program, so I just fixed the broken code. Everything works :)
